# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.9.1] - 2025-11-24

### Fixed
- History search box now shows a visible cursor with full editing support
  - Left/right arrow keys move cursor within search text
  - Insert and delete at any position (not just end)
- History popup no longer collapses when search has no matches
- Multi-word search now works correctly (space-separated terms are ANDed, like fzf)
  - e.g., `headquarters building` matches entries containing both terms

## [2.9.0] - 2025-11-24

### Added
- Autocomplete suggestions for root-level JSON arrays
  - Pressing `.` on `[{"id": 1}, ...]` now suggests `.[]`, `.[].id`, `.[].field`, etc.
  - Previously showed no suggestions for top-level arrays
  - Supports prefix filtering (typing `n` filters to `.[].name`, `.[].notes`, etc.)
  - Handles edge cases: empty arrays, arrays of primitives, nested arrays

## [2.8.0] - 2025-11-24

### Added
- Smart array field autocomplete with proper jq syntax
  - Typing `.array.` now suggests `[]`, `[].field1`, `[].field2` (guides user to use iterator)
  - Typing `.array | .` now suggests `.[]`, `.[].field1`, `.[].field2` (preserves dot after pipe)
  - Typing `.array[].` shows normal `.field` suggestions (iterator already present)
  - Works with all array access patterns: `[]`, `[0]`, `[0:5]`
- Standalone `[]` iterator suggestion when at an array (with description "iterate all elements")

### Improved
- Suggestion type labels are now more descriptive:
  - `fn` → `function`
  - `op` → `operator`
  - `pat` → `iterator`
- Added 12 new tests for comprehensive array autocomplete coverage

## [2.7.2] - 2025-11-24

### Fixed
- Scroll position now properly clamped to content bounds - prevents scrolling past results into empty space
- 'q' key now works correctly in Results pane regardless of editor mode (fixes confusing behavior after focus switch)
- Line count calculation now matches displayed content when showing cached results after query errors
- Large files with >65,535 lines now handled correctly without overflow

### Improved
- Added comprehensive test coverage for scroll behavior, quit key interactions, and large file handling

## [2.7.1] - 2025-11-24

### Fixed
- Pressing 'q' in Insert mode no longer quits the application - allows typing queries like `unique`, `eq`, etc. (thanks @dithmer!)

## [2.7.0] - 2025-11-24

### Added
- Persistent query history with fuzzy search
- `Ctrl+P` / `Ctrl+N` - Quick cycle through previous/next queries

- Automatic deduplication of duplicate queries
- History limited to last 1000 entries

## [2.6.2] - 2025-11-24

### Added
- `Ctrl+Q` keybinding to exit and output query string only (universal fallback for terminals that don't support `Shift+Enter`)

### Fixed
- `Shift+Enter` and `Alt+Enter` not working in some terminal emulators (e.g., macOS Terminal.app)

## [2.6.1] - 2025-11-23

### Added
- JSON type information in autocomplete suggestions (String, Number, Boolean, Array, Object, Null)
- Array element type detection - shows specific types like Array[String], Array[Object], Array[Number]
- Nested array type support - displays Array[Array[Number]] for multi-dimensional arrays
- Floating error overlay with Ctrl+E toggle - errors no longer disrupt results pane layout
- Error indicator (⚠) in input field title when syntax error exists

### Improved
- Autocomplete popup now has solid background with better contrast
- Selected suggestion uses cyan highlight with black text for improved visibility
- Type labels right-aligned in autocomplete for cleaner appearance
- Results pane maintains constant height - no more jarring movement when errors occur
- Error overlay auto-hides when query is modified

### Fixed
- Fixed popup width calculation to accommodate longer type labels
