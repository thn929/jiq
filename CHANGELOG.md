  - `h`/`l`/`←`/`→` to scroll 1 column left/right
  - `H`/`L` to scroll 10 columns left/right
  - `0`/`^` to jump to left edge
  - `$` to jump to right edge
  - `End` key to jump to bottom (alongside `G`)

### Documentation
- Updated README and help popup with horizontal scroll keybindings

## [2.14.1] - 2025-11-27

### Improved
- Context-aware help text in INPUT mode that adapts to input state
  - Empty input: Shows history navigation shortcuts (Ctrl+P/N to cycle, ↑/Ctrl+R to open popup)
  - Has content: Shows exit shortcuts and history popup access
  - Always visible: Shift+Tab for pane switching, ↑/Ctrl+R for history
- Up arrow (↑) now always opens history popup, not just when input is empty
  - More consistent with Ctrl+R behavior
  - Better discoverability of history features

### Changed
- Improved terminology in help text for clarity
  - "Exit with Results" → "Output Result"
  - "Exit with Query" → "Output Query"
  - "Switch Focus" → "Switch Pane"
- Use arrow symbol (↑) for more compact display in help text

### Documentation
- Updated README to reflect new Up arrow behavior

## [2.14.0] - 2025-11-27

### Improved

## [2.13.0] - 2025-11-25

### Added
- Ctrl+Q keybind to exit with query output (primary method, works in all terminals)
  - Alternative to Shift+Enter and Alt+Enter which may not work in all terminals
  - Saves successful queries to history before exiting
  - Failed queries still exit but are not saved to history

### Fixed
- Input text now scrolls left to fill space when deleting characters
  - Previously left empty space on the right when deleting from long queries
  - Text automatically adjusts to show as much content as possible
  - Cursor remains visible throughout deletion

### Changed
- Refactored input rendering architecture to eliminate cursor desynchronization
  - Replaced overlay rendering with direct styled Paragraph rendering
  - Use tui-textarea for editing logic only, not for rendering
  - Simplifies codebase and prevents cursor position bugs
  - Matches the proven pattern used in results pane rendering

### Internal
- Added 12 scroll offset and synchronization tests
- Added 9 unit tests for span extraction and cursor insertion
- Added 6 comprehensive tests for Ctrl+Q, Shift+Enter, Alt+Enter
- Replaced 5 redundant tests with proper unit tests
- All 374 tests passing

## [2.12.1] - 2025-11-25

### Added
- VIM keybinding `^` in Normal mode - moves cursor to start of line (same as `0`)
- Support for `^` in Operator mode - enables `d^` and `c^` operations

## [2.12.0] - 2025-11-25

### Added
- Syntax highlighting now works for queries of any length
  - Previously disabled for queries longer than terminal width
  - Highlighted text correctly follows horizontal scrolling
  - Colors remain visible even in very long queries

### Fixed
- Cursor jump bug when deleting characters from long queries

- Implemented scroll-aware syntax highlighting overlay
- Added scroll offset tracking to mirror tui-textarea's internal state
- Extract visible portions of highlighted text based on scroll position
- All 352 tests passing

## [2.11.0] - 2025-11-25

### Fixed
- Autocomplete Tab now correctly appends array suggestions instead of replacing entire query
  - Example: Typing `.services` + accepting `[].name` now correctly produces `.services[].name`
  - Previously replaced entire query with just `[].name`
- History now correctly saves successful queries on Enter/Shift+Enter/Alt+Enter
  - Queries are persisted to `~/.jiq_history` for use in future sessions
  - Failed queries and empty queries are not saved

### Changed
- **Major internal refactoring for improved maintainability** (no user-facing changes)
  - Extracted event handlers into focused modules (vim, global, history, results)
  - Reduced `events.rs` from 2,469 to 148 lines (94% reduction)

- Improved code organization with clear module boundaries

## [2.10.0] - 2025-11-25

### Added
- Comprehensive keyboard shortcuts help popup

  - Full vim-style scrolling: `j/k`, `J/K`, `g/G`, `Ctrl+D/U`, arrow keys, PageUp/PageDown, Home/End
  - Organized by context: Global, Insert mode, Normal mode, Autocomplete, Results pane, History, Error overlay
  - Mode-aware bottom help line shows relevant keys for current mode

### Fixed
- Help popup now works reliably across all terminal emulators
  - Replaced `Ctrl+/` (sends ASCII 0x1F, poorly supported) with `F1` and `?`
  - `F1` works in all modes and focus contexts
  - `?` works in Normal mode and Results pane only
- Terminal resize no longer crashes when help popup is open
  - Popup dimensions now clamp to terminal size
  - Gracefully skips rendering on very small terminals (<20x10)
- Scroll position correctly resets after jumping to bottom with `G`
  - Previously required multiple key presses to scroll up after `G`

  - e.g., `headquarters building` matches entries containing both terms

## [2.9.0] - 2025-11-24

### Added
- Autocomplete suggestions for root-level JSON arrays
  - Pressing `.` on `[{"id": 1}, ...]` now suggests `.[]`, `.[].id`, `.[].field`, etc.
  - Previously showed no suggestions for top-level arrays
  - Supports prefix filtering (typing `n` filters to `.[].name`, `.[].notes`, etc.)
  - Handles edge cases: empty arrays, arrays of primitives, nested arrays

## [2.8.0] - 2025-11-24

### Added
- Smart array field autocomplete with proper jq syntax
  - Typing `.array.` now suggests `[]`, `[].field1`, `[].field2` (guides user to use iterator)
  - Typing `.array | .` now suggests `.[]`, `.[].field1`, `.[].field2` (preserves dot after pipe)
  - Typing `.array[].` shows normal `.field` suggestions (iterator already present)
  - Works with all array access patterns: `[]`, `[0]`, `[0:5]`
- Standalone `[]` iterator suggestion when at an array (with description "iterate all elements")

### Improved
- Suggestion type labels are now more descriptive:
  - `fn` → `function`
  - `op` → `operator`
  - `pat` → `iterator`
- Added 12 new tests for comprehensive array autocomplete coverage

## [2.7.2] - 2025-11-24

### Fixed
